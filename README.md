# NYC-311-Calls-Data-Analysis

This Project is an analysis of NYC 311 calls dataset with 18,774,870 entries since 2010 from the [NYC OpenData website](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9).   


### This Project answers the following major questions:
 
* Find Patterns in Data
* Display City and Complaint Type Together
* Find the top 10 complaint types
* Plot graph of count vs. complaint types
* Visualize major complaint types and their count

Data is not included because it too large to upload (10GB). You can download directly from the [NYC OpenData website](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9).
